# OpenCMD

OpenCMD is alpha software not intended as a daily driver shell. It is however getting frequent features and fixes.

## Building

Install make with Chocolatey and run `run.bat`.

## Contributing

We need contributors for such a large project. Anyone who wants to contribute by either submitting issues or pull requests is welcome, as long as they follow our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md].

## Roadmap

OpenCMD aims to fully reimplement the Windows command prompt, providing a free and open source actively maintained alternative.
