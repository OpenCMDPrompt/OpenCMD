# OpenCMD

OpenCMD is alpha software not intended as a daily driver shell. It is however getting frequent features and fixes.

## Building

Install make with Chocolatey and run `run.bat`.

## Contributing

Anyone who wants to contribute by either submitting issues or pull requests is welcome, as long as they follow our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Roadmap

OpenCMD aims to be a reimplementation of `CMD.EXE`. Rather than fully reimplementating it, OpenCMD aims to be "good enough" to run most CMD.EXE scripts. That is still a large project, but a lot smaller than trying to fully reimplement `CMD.EXE`.
